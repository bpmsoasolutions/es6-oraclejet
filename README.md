# Oracle Jet Base Project ES6

This is a base project overpowered with this technologies:

* Oracle Jet
* Fully ES6 compatible
* Gulp, Babel and some othe cool features
* Crossroads and hasher for routing
* KnockoutJs
* Jet-komponents Library
* MomentJs
* Axios
* Font awesome for icons (already compatible with jet icons)

In this project we tried to help devs to adopt new ECMAScript 6 flow. Using Oracle Jet. We show the potential of ES6 modules, and we provide a Gulp (Task manager) full configure, with all you need out of the box.

* Run `npm install`
* Run `bower install` (if you not have globally`./node_modules/.bin/bower`)
* Run `gulp serve:src` (if you not have globally `./node_modules/.bin/gulp`)

**Note**: For install globally run `npm install -g bower gulp`, else use node_modules included version.

## Tasks included

We provide basic tasks to help you with your project:

* `serve:src` : Serve the src folder with es6 compilation on fly
* `serve:dist` : Compile the project and serve the distribution folder to test it
